# Newsletter Manual Publish Runbook

## Purpose
Provide operators with a consistent checklist for taking auto-generated newsletter assets and publishing them in Beehiv while tracking completion and performance notes.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Beehiv dashboard with permission to create and send posts.
- Slack alerts enabled for the `#boring-ops` channel.
- Access to Neon Postgres (or admin UI) for updating `newsletter_issues` records.
- Export assets generated by the `NEWSLETTER-DRAFT-GENERATOR` workflow (Markdown + HTML links).

## Inputs
- Slack notification containing:
  - Issue ID
  - Subject line options
  - Links to Markdown/HTML (and optional Google Doc) files stored in `newsletter_issues.export_assets`
  - CTA summary and key talking points

## Manual Publish Checklist
1. **Acknowledge Notification**  
   - React ✅ in Slack to indicate you are taking ownership.  
   - Open the linked runbook (this document) if clarification is needed.

2. **Review Content Assets**  
   - Download/open Markdown file for plain-text view.  
   - Open HTML snippet if you prefer formatted copy.  
   - If a Google Doc link is provided, confirm permissions allow editing.

3. **Apply Beehiv Updates**  
   - Log into Beehiv → `Posts` → `Create Post`.  
   - Paste the preferred subject line into the title field.  
   - Paste the HTML snippet into the editor (fallback: use Markdown and adjust formatting).  
   - Insert CTA buttons/links per CTA summary; verify all URLs work.  
   - Add images or embeds as needed (none are auto-inserted).

4. **QA & Formatting**  
   - Check headings, bullet lists, tables, and bold/italic text.  
   - Ensure spacing between sections is consistent.  
   - Verify contact information or data references mirror the generated content.  
   - Adjust preview text / email preheader using the provided snippet.

5. **Schedule or Send**  
   - Choose send time aligned with campaign calendar.  
   - Select audience segment (default: entire list unless otherwise noted).  
   - Save draft and send test email to yourself if time allows.  
   - Schedule or send immediately once approved.

6. **Update Internal Tracking**  
   - In Neon (or admin UI), update `newsletter_issues` for the issue:
     ```sql
     UPDATE newsletter_issues
     SET status = 'sent',
         published_manually_at = now(),
         publish_notes = 'Sent via Beehiv on <date/time>; subject: <chosen subject>'
     WHERE issue_id = '<issue_id>';
     ```
   - Record additional notes: formatting tweaks, audience changes, observed issues.

7. **Confirm Completion**  
   - Reply in Slack thread with completion note and any key observations.  
   - If send is scheduled for later, mention the scheduled time.

## SLA & Reminders
- Target completion: within **24 hours** of newsletter draft creation.  
- n8n reminder workflow will ping operators if `published_manually_at` remains NULL after 24 hours.  
- Escalate to Alex Johnson if manual publish is blocked (access issues, content concerns).

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Slack link broken | Open `newsletter_issues.export_assets` in DB to retrieve raw URLs. |
| Markdown renders poorly in Beehiv | Use HTML snippet; double-check closing tags. |
| Beehiv login/access error | Verify account permissions or contact Beehiv support. |
| Content requires edits | Make changes directly in Beehiv and note adjustments in `publish_notes`. |
| Need prior version | Export assets are versioned; check storage path or regenerate via workflow rerun. |

## Metrics & Follow-Up
- After send, capture open/click rates in `publish_notes` or a dedicated analytics sheet until automation is available.  
- Share learnings in weekly ops sync to refine prompts and CTA strategy.
